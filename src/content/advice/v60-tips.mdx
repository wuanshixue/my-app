My experience with immersion brewing methods has so far consisted of my beloved French presses and my AeroPress. I know there are a lot of AeroPress fans out there (there’s even a World AeroPress Championship tournament coming up next week!), but after owning and using mine for many years, I’ve finally accepted that we’re just not right for each other. Comparing the results I get out of it vs. the results I get out of my other brewing methods, the AeroPress coffee is very rarely my favorite of the lot, and while it does make good coffee, the mechanics of the method make it the one brewing method I least look forward to trying out in every coffee bean review.

Conversely, my French presses are probably my favorite brewing method of them all. I love the rich, full-bodied, creamy, silky texture of French press/cafetière coffee. The main drawback to this method is the bit of silt that lives at the bottom of your cup; the final sips of French press coffee often are muddy and gritty. Of course, it’s simple to just not drink the last bit of your coffee to avoid drinking the coffee silt, but it does feel wasteful.

I’ve been aware of the Clever Dripper for close to a decade now. In fact, I included some information about it in my post from 2015 regarding how to choose the right manual coffee maker for you. I did seriously consider getting one, but I figured two immersion methods (French press, AeroPress) and two pourover methods (Chemex, Hario V60) were plenty, and would give me the right balance of ‘contestants’ to face off in my coffee bean reviews. But, since I’ve now decided to retire my AeroPress from these ‘match-ups,’ I thought it would be interesting to test out the Clever Dripper as a possible replacement.
