This is the last bag from my recent order from Heart. Right from the start, when I cut open the bag, the coffee smelled strong and fragrant. It bodes well, especially since I thought the last bag I reviewed from Heart was underwhelming!

Whole beans: Buttery, rich, sweet fragrance. Definite notes of butterscotch and a light subtle floral fragrance – I’m not familiar with what cherry blossoms smell like, but I’ll take the roaster’s word for it. There is also a hint of a vegetal aroma, kind of savory, like serrano peppers? But I didn’t smell this savory note anymore once the beans were ground.

Hario V60: The coffee is less sweet in the cup than the aroma of the beans suggested it would be, but it is delicious. Medium-bodied, As it cools, more of the sweet floral notes come out. I enjoyed this a lot.

Clever Dripper: I’ve had bad luck recently with Clever Dripper coffee as I’ve found the results bland, but this was pretty good! It made a smoother and sweeter cup than the Hario V60; less character, but still very pleasant.

Chemex: Virtually the same in taste, texture, etc. as the Clever Dripper cup.

French press: In my opinion, this was the best method for these beans. Fuller-bodied with more layers of flavor, it was the most interesting and pleasurable cup to drink. I’m looking forward to making this again tomorrow.

Summary: I liked these beans quite a lot! There’s a richness and a sweetness to them that is delicious in the cup. All of the brewing methods tasted good but the French press cup was my favorite, because it brought out the most flavor.

From the roaster: pomegranate, cherry blossom, butterscotch

This coffee is no longer available for sale on Heart’s online store.

Review conducted 34 days post-roast.
